Here are example config files for reproducing the eBOSS DR16 BAO analysis (table 6 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08995). You need to put in the right paths to the measured correlations and metal matrices. You can download these from here: https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/eboss/DR16cosmo/tags/v1_0_1/dataveccov/lya_forest/. In order to run these, just call the "picca_fitter2.py" script (found in the bin folder) with the path to the chi2.ini file. The chi2.ini configs are setup to run the full scan over the BAO parameters (ap,at), however this can be very slow. If you only want to run the fit, just comment out (or delete) the entire section [chi2 scan] from each chi2.ini file.
