This tutorial contains the files and instructions necessary for reproducing the eBOSS DR16 analysis on your local computer. Follow the instructions in the notebook to reproduce this analysis. If you are part of DESI and are looking for instructions for how to reproduce this analysis at NERSC you can find a notebook in this repository, on the [DESI wiki](https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/LymanAlphaWG/ReproduceSDSS/eBOSS_task_force) (under task C) or you can find the notebook at NERSC at  `/global/cfs/cdirs/desi/science/lya/eboss_dr16/tutorials/nersc_tutorial.ipynb`. <br><br> If you want to compare your results to the official results check the plots in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08995.pdf). You can also find some (not official) plots in the `results/Plots` folder in this repo.

The `Scripts/send_cor.py` file is meant for use with the non-NERSC tutorial!
